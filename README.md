# Markov_SIR
This project implements an SIR-Markov Chain simulator to simulate the spread of an infectious disease throughout a state. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the need to project the spread of an infectious disease became apparent, and the often default model is SIR. The SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model represents a closed population where individuals move from the categories over time based on an infection rate (beta) and a recovery rate (gamma). Although many public health interventions were established to stop the spread of COVID-19, movement was inevitable, and the disease ultimately spread to all corners of the world. The proposed model accounts for such movement by integrating a Markov Chain with the SIR model to simulate the transition of people from one county to another. This simulation can predict the spread over the 159 counties in Georgia over a given number of days, starting from any county. For validation purposes, the initial infected population was contained in Fulton County, the location of the first reported cases in Georgia, and the simulated spread of COVID-19 over three months reflected the actual reported spread in Georgia using the USAFacts.org database. This simulator can predict the spread of an infectious disease in any state, starting with any county, to help inform public health interventions.
